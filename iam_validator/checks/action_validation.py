"""Action validation check - validates IAM actions against AWS service definitions.

This check ensures that all actions specified in IAM policies are valid actions
defined by AWS services. It helps identify typos or deprecated actions that may
lead to unintended access permissions.

This check is not necessary when using Access Analyzer, as it performs similar
validations. However, it can be useful in environments where Access Analyzer is
not available or for pre-deployment policy validation to catch errors early.
