    Expand wildcard actions to their actual action names using AWS API.

    This function expands wildcard patterns like "s3:*", "ec2:Delete*", "iam:*User*"
    to the actual action names they grant. This is crucial for sensitive action
    detection to catch wildcards that include sensitive actions.

    Examples:
        ["s3:GetObject", "ec2:*"] -> ["s3:GetObject", "ec2:DeleteVolume", "ec2:TerminateInstances", ...]
        ["iam:Delete*"] -> ["iam:DeleteUser", "iam:DeleteRole", "iam:DeleteAccessKey", ...]
